    //Pushing data to stack is faster than heap because we always allocate memory at the top of the stack whereas in heap, we have to find a place in data which has the required amount of size, create pointer, etc.
    //Similarly, accessing data from stack is faster than heap because we need to use pointers to access heap memory

    // a. Run a Garbage Collector

    //In the above case, the metadata for variable for s1 is stored in the stack, whereas the actual value (hello) is stored on the heap.
    //The pointer for the value of s1 is stored as a part of metadata on the stack,
    //When we store s2 = s1, we create a copy of s1's metadata and store it on the stack, and now s2 points to the same reference on the stack that s1 was previously pointing
    //In this case, once we assign s1 to s2, Rust calls drop on s1 and the value is removed from stack.
    //This is to prevent 'double fee' error - where if both s1 and s2 go out of scope, the program tries to free the same memory twice causing error
    //In the above case, the s2 = s2 uses the move function in rust which moves the pointer from s1 to s2 and frees up s1 memory on stack

    //If we want to keep both s1 and s2, we can use the 'copy' function in rust
